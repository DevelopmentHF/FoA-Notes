# COMP10002 Notes Summary

These notes are focused on summarising some of the algorithms covered.<br>
I have attempted to explain things in a general format as well at the start of each new algorithm. <br>

>Note, the 'pseudocode' is formatted into as close to C as possible. <br>
>I have tried to change most of the variable names for clarity purposes.
